# backend/services/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'services' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import service functions here for easier access, e.g.:
# from .user_service import register_user_db, authenticate_user_db
# from .tree_service import create_tree_db
# ... and so on.

# However, it's often cleaner to import directly from the specific service module
# where needed, e.g., from backend.services.user_service import ...
