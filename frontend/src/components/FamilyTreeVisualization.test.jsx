  // Helper to simulate onConnect call
  // In a real React Flow environment, onConnect is called by the library.
  // Here, we need to manually find the instance and call its onConnect prop.
  // However, React Testing Library doesn't easily expose component instance methods directly.
  // A common approach is to test the callback function `handleOnConnect` more directly
  // if it were exported, or by finding a way to trigger it through UI if possible.
  // Since `onConnect` is a prop of ReactFlow, we'd ideally trigger a connection event.
  // For simplicity in this context, we'll test the modal opening logic that `handleOnConnect` triggers.
  // We assume ReactFlow correctly calls `onConnect` with params.

    // We need a way to call `handleOnConnect` which is internal.
    // For this test, we'll assume `handleOnConnect` is correctly wired to ReactFlow's `onConnect`.
    // The test will focus on the modal opening and data passing.
    
    // Manually set connection and open modal to test modal's behavior
    // This bypasses direct testing of onConnect itself but tests the modal flow.
    // A more integrated test would require deeper React Flow interaction simulation.
    
    // Let's find a way to trigger the modal via a conceptual onConnect
    // We'll mock the onConnect prop of ReactFlow to call our handler
    // This is typically done by finding the ReactFlow instance and calling its prop.
    // However, `screen.getByRole` doesn't give us the React instance.
    //
    // Alternative: We can't directly call `handleOnConnect` as it's not exposed.
