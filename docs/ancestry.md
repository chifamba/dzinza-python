Based on the provided sources, here is a detailed explanation of Ancestry.com's features and functionality, focusing on the user interface and how it interacts with users.

Ancestry.com offers various tools and features for building family trees, exploring historical records, and utilizing DNA results for genealogical research. These features can broadly be categorized into free services, subscription-based access to records, and an additional paid "Pro Tools" add-on subscription.

**Core Ancestry Features (Available with Free Tree or Subscription):**

1.  **Tree Building:**
    *   Anyone can build a family tree on Ancestry.com for free.
    *   The tree serves as your storage and research space.
    *   You can create a **new tree** or **upload a GEDCOM file** to start or add to your tree.
    *   **Managing Trees:** Users can manage multiple trees if needed, often accessible from the "Trees" menu. The tree settings allow changing the **tree name** and **description**, setting the **home person** (the default person displayed when accessing the tree), and determining **who you are** in the tree (important for relationship calculations).
    *   **Inviting Others:** Users can invite others to participate in or view their tree with different levels of access.
    *   **Privacy Settings:** Trees can be set to **public** or **private**.

2.  **Tree Views:**
    *   Ancestry offers different ways to visualize your family tree data.
    *   **Pedigree View (Horizontal View):** This is the standard view, showing a person, their parents, grandparents, and so on, focusing on direct ancestors marching back in time.
    *   **Vertical View:** This view flips the tree, allowing users to see siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins, helping to explore the broader family structure.
    *   **Fan View:** This presents the pedigree in a radial chart format. The basic Fan View is available to everyone.

3.  **Charts and Reports:**
    *   Some basic charts and reports are available to look at family history data in different ways.
    *   Examples include **Family Group Sheets** (showing parents and children in a single family unit), **On and Toel Reports** (listing ancestors by generation), **Descendancy Reports** (showing descendants of a chosen ancestor), and **Register Style** reports.
    *   Reports can be **downloaded, printed, or shared**, typically in a PDF format. Note: Printing directly might have limitations or require Pro Tools for certain features.

4.  **List of All People:**
    *   A list of every person in your tree is available.
    *   This list can be **searched by name**.
    *   **Filtering:** The standard list can be filtered using **tree tags**.

5.  **Person Profile Page:**
    *   Clicking on a person's name, often a clickable link from various views or lists, opens their profile page in a new tab.
    *   **Facts Tab:** This is the default view, showing a timeline of life events (birth, death, residence, etc.) entered for the person. Facts can be added or edited. On the side, it shows **family relationships** (parents, siblings, spouses, children).
    *   **Life Story Tab:** Ancestry compiles entered facts into a narrative life story. Beta AI features may offer historical context.
    *   **Gallery Tab:** This section shows **images, stories, audio, and video** attached specifically to that person. Images can often be viewed, downloaded (if uploaded or from other members), and sometimes edited.
    *   **Hints Tab:** Displays **hints** Ancestry has found related to the person, suggesting potential historical records or other member trees that might provide more information. Users can **review, ignore, or mark hints as undecided**. Reviewing a hint opens a **side panel** or can be viewed **full screen** to compare suggested information with existing tree data. Note: Reviewing hints responsibly is advised, especially regarding other member trees.
    *   **Explore Tab (Beta):** This experimental feature shows historical context and images related to times and places associated with the ancestor.
    *   **Tools Menu:** On the profile page, a tools menu provides options like **showing research tools**, **viewing the person in the tree** (setting them as the focus person), accessing **notes** (private) and **comments** (public), **merging duplicates**, **saving to another tree**, **printing the person page**, and **connecting with other members** researching the same person.

6.  **Sources and Records:**
    *   Access to Ancestry's vast collection of **historical records** requires a subscription.
    *   Records can be searched using the main **Search** function, either searching all collections or specific categories like census, birth/marriage/death, military, immigration, etc.. Searching from a profile page populates the search with that person's information.
    *   The **Card Catalog** allows searching for specific record collections that might not appear in general searches.
    *   When records are found and attached to individuals in the tree (often via hints or search results), this creates **source citations**. Users can also **add sources manually**.
    *   Source citations are visible on the **Facts tab** of the person's profile page and are linked to the facts they support.

7.  **DNA Integration:**
    *   DNA testing is a major component of Ancestry.
    *   Users who have taken an AncestryDNA test receive a **list of DNA matches** and **shared matches** (people they have in common with a specific match).
    *   DNA results can be integrated with the family tree. A **DNA match icon** can appear next to individuals in the tree.
    *   **Throughlines** is a feature based on linking DNA matches to potential common ancestors using member trees, though caution is advised as it relies on other trees.

8.  **Tree Tags:**
    *   A highly useful **free feature** is the ability to add **tags** to individuals in the tree.
    *   Ancestry provides set tags (e.g., research statuses, life experiences, DNA tags).
    *   Users can also create a large number of **custom tags** (up to 80) for workflow management (e.g., "start here," "check notes"), specific experiences, or research plans (e.g., "next trip to archive").
    *   Tags can be used as a **filter** on the list of all people.

9.  **Messaging:**
    *   Users can message other Ancestry members, including DNA matches, through the platform without exposing email addresses.

10. **GEDCOM Download:**
    *   Trees can be downloaded as a **.GED (GEDCOM) file**.
    *   This is useful for **backup purposes** or for **transferring the tree** to other genealogy software or websites.
    *   **Workflow:** Go to Tree Settings -> Export tree -> Export Anyway -> Download your GEDCOM file.
    *   Note: **Ancestry's GEDCOM files currently do not include associated images**; they contain the people, facts, and source citations. Family Tree Maker software is mentioned as an alternative that syncs differently and can handle images.

**Ancestry Pro Tools Features (Requires Add-on Subscription):**

Pro Tools is an extra subscription layer designed to help users with large trees manage their information and make new discoveries. It adds enhanced functionality to existing features and introduces new tools. Access is gained by adding Pro Tools to an existing Ancestry subscription. A dedicated Pro Tools widget on the homepage provides shortcuts to these features.

1.  **Enhanced Tree Views:**
    *   **Fan View:** Pro Tools subscribers get **extra generations** (up to 7) in the Fan View.
    *   **Fan View Heat Maps:** Pro Tools adds **heat map overlays** to the Fan View, visualizing the density of information. This can show:
        *   **Hints:** Areas with more or fewer hints.
        *   **Photos:** Areas with more or fewer photos/documents.
        *   **Sources:** Areas with more or fewer source citations attached.
        *   This helps quickly identify research gaps or areas with rich data.

2.  **Enhanced Charts and Reports:**
    *   Pro Tools allows accessing **more generations** (up to 7) for reports like the On and Toel Report.
    *   Additional **formatting options** are available for printing.
    *   These enhanced reports can be downloaded as PDFs.

3.  **Tree Mapper:**
    *   This tool visualizes the locations associated with people and events in your tree on an interactive map.
    *   It helps visualize **patterns** of migration and geographical concentration of ancestors.
    *   **Filtering:** The map can be filtered to show:
        *   **Different branches:** Whole tree, direct line, paternal side, maternal side.
        *   **Specific events:** Any event, births, marriages, deaths, residence, military, immigration, etc..
        *   **Specific groups:** End of Line people (brick walls), floating people.
    *   The map uses a **legend** and **color density** (heat map) to indicate the concentration of people in specific locations.
    *   As you **zoom in**, the map can display data at increasingly granular levels, potentially going down to the **county level** if locations are entered and standardized correctly.
    *   Clicking or hovering over areas on the map shows the number of people associated with that location.
    *   This tool is valuable for identifying research areas, understanding migration, and getting familiar with ancestor locations.

4.  **Enhanced List of All People (Smart Filters):**
    *   Pro Tools adds **additional filtering capabilities** to the list of all people.
    *   **Filtering by Family Line:** Filter by direct line ancestors, paternal side, maternal side, end of line people, or people without relationships (floating people).
    *   **Filtering by Place and Date:** Filter the list to show people from **specific places** or within **specific year ranges**. These filters can be combined (e.g., people born between 1800-1825 in North Carolina). This allows creating targeted lists for research trips or specific research questions.

5.  **Error Checker (Tree Checker):**
    *   This feature helps identify potential issues in your tree data. It is accessed as a filter on the list of all people.
    *   It highlights **possible errors**, including:
        *   **Possible Duplicates:** Flags individuals that Ancestry's system believes might be the same person entered multiple times. The less information available, the more suggestions may appear. Reviewing duplicates often involves comparing profile pages side-by-side. Users can then **merge** duplicate individuals.
        *   **People with No Sources:** Lists individuals in the tree who do not have a standard Ancestry source citation attached. This includes people whose information was copied only from other trees. Cleaning this list helps ensure data accuracy.
        *   **People with Only Tree Sources:** Specifically lists individuals whose only source is another member's tree.
        *   **Other Possible Errors:** A category for other flagged data issues.
    *   Clicking on the exclamation point icon next to a person on the error list opens their profile with details about the potential error.
    *   Using the error checker helps **clean up the tree** and identify self-created brick walls.

6.  **Tree Rating:**
    *   Pro Tools provides a **tree rating score** (e.g., 7.0 out of 10) based on the tree's cleanliness, particularly related to sources and duplicates. Improving this score involves addressing the errors identified by the Error Checker.

7.  **Explore Your Insights:**
    *   Provides fun **data facts** about your tree, such as the most common surnames. It can also reveal potential errors, like placeholder names indicating missing information.

8.  **Enhanced Shared Matches:**
    *   This feature combines DNA information with the family tree.
    *   For your DNA matches, in addition to showing how much DNA you share with them, the enhanced shared match list includes an **extra column** showing **how much DNA your match shares with their shared matches**.
    *   Users can **sort** the shared match list by this third column.
    *   This is described as a powerful tool for understanding relationships and breaking through brick walls.

**User Interface and Interaction:**

Ancestry's interface uses several consistent elements:
*   **Navigation Bar:** A top menu provides access to main sections like Trees, Memories, DNA, and Search.
*   **Side Toolbars:** Tree views often have a toolbar on the left side with icons for zooming, returning to the home person, and accessing settings or feature lists (like Pro Tools shortcuts).
*   **Icons:** Icons are used extensively to convey information quickly, such as hints (green leaf), comments (speech bubble), DNA matches (DNA tag), and possible errors (exclamation point).
*   **Clickable Links:** Names, record titles, and other elements are often clickable to navigate to profile pages, sources, or other relevant sections.
*   **Filters:** Various lists and views (List of All People, Map, Gallery, Search results) offer filter options to narrow down the displayed information based on criteria like name, tags, family line, place, date, or event type. Filter interfaces often involve dropdowns, text fields, or checkboxes.
*   **Tabs:** Profile pages use tabs (Facts, Life Story, Gallery, Hints, Explore) to organize different types of information about a person.
*   **Side Panels/Windows:** Some interactions, like reviewing hints or possible duplicates, open information or comparison tools in a side panel or temporary window.
*   **Popups:** Hovering over icons or elements sometimes displays tooltips or brief information popups.
*   **Heat Maps:** Visual representations (like the Fan View or Tree Mapper) use varying color intensity to indicate the density or quantity of specific data points in different areas.
*   **Interactive Maps:** The Tree Mapper allows users to zoom, pan, and filter data displayed geographically. Clicking or hovering over map elements provides details.
*   **Settings Pages:** Dedicated pages accessed through menus or icons allow users to customize various aspects of their tree, account, and preferences.
*   **Feedback Links:** Some pages, particularly related to newer features like Pro Tools, include feedback links for users to submit suggestions.

Based on the sources, the user interface is designed to allow navigation between different views of the tree (horizontal, vertical, fan, map), lists of people (filterable), and detailed profile pages for individuals. User interaction primarily involves clicking icons, navigating menus, using filters, reviewing information presented in timelines, lists, or side panels, and utilizing dedicated tools like the Error Checker or Tree Mapper. The Pro Tools add-on enhances several of these existing interfaces with additional filters, views, and data visualization capabilities.
